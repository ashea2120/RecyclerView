# CE-450 Lab 4 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 4 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and RecyclerView
 
This repo is for the following Practice Set:
- CodeLabs Android Fundamentals 04.5: RecyclerView
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Learned how to properly use a RecyclerView which displays a long scrollable list of words using a linkedlist
- Utilized skills from previous labs to implement a new logo icon and actions for the FAB button
- Learned about the RecyclerView's behavior and how it ties in with a LayoutManager, Adapter, and ViewHolder
- Implemented an Adapter and ViewHolder in the code
  * It was interesting to see how they threw in a class inside of a class, that's a different implementation that I would have expected to see
- Learned how to make the view slightly interactive, ie. interact with the elements and add new elements to the linkedlist
